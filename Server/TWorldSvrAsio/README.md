# TWorldSvrAsio — modernized cluster coordinator

Wire-compatible replacement for `Server/TWorldSvr/` (38 851 LOC,
30 files) running on the `FourStoryCommon` infrastructure (SOCI
pool, spdlog audit, health endpoint) and the `boost::asio` reactor
that the four shipped Asio daemons already use.

### W2 — what's done, what's deferred

A grep of the legacy code showed that **TWorldSvr does NOT load
characters from the database** — it's a cluster-wide in-memory
index of chars that map servers have already loaded. The legacy
`DBAccess.h` has 78 `CSP*` stored-procedure wrappers but none of
them are char-load (the char-load CSPs live in TLoginSvr +
TMapSvr). So "char persistence" in TWorld really means **char
registry** — the in-memory `m_mapTCHAR` + `m_mapACTIVEUSER` —
which is exactly the global-lock target named in PATCH_README §6
W-2.

**Done in W2:**
* `services/char_registry.{h,cpp}` — 16-shard hash map with
  per-shard `std::shared_mutex` (fast read path under the W3
  guild lookups) + per-char `std::mutex` for field-level mutation
  ("per-char actor model" from W-2). Active-user index is a
  separate sharded set.
* DB infrastructure in `main.cpp` — when `[database]` is set, a
  `fourstory::db::SessionPool` + `boost::asio::thread_pool` come
  up. W2 doesn't issue any queries; W3a is the first phase that
  exercises this.
* `handlers/handlers_char.cpp` — `OnAddCharAck` (MW_ADDCHAR_ACK)
  inserts into the registry, marks user active, and handles the
  "additional connection" branch (TCharCon push). `OnCloseCharAck`
  (MW_CLOSECHAR_ACK) removes the entry, deactivates the user
  when no other char of theirs is online.
* Tests: `test_char_registry` (6 scenarios — insert/find/remove,
  duplicate-insert rejection, snapshot consistency, active-user
  index, concurrent inserts × 16k chars, shared_ptr lifetime),
  `test_char_handlers` (5 wire scenarios — happy path, additional
  connection, wrong key, close + user deactivation, stale close).

**Deferred to W3+ (each gated on a piece that doesn't exist yet):**
* **Peer-server registry** — `OnAddCharAck` records
  `TCharCon::server_id = 0` because the WorldSession doesn't yet
  carry the map-server's `wID`. W3 introduces a `PeerSession`
  wrapper (parallel to `Server/TControlSvrAsio/peer_session.h`)
  that knows which map server is on the other end.
* **`SendMW_ENTERSVR_REQ`** — the ACK back to the map server
  saying "yes, the char is registered". Requires a sender layer
  (TWorldSvr's `SSSender.cpp` counterpart) which is 4046 LOC; the
  first batch lands with the W3a guild work because the guild
  acks need it too.
* **`SendMW_INVALIDCHAR_REQ`** — fired on wrong-key collision
  ("possible session hijack" branch in the legacy module). Same
  blocker as ENTERSVR_REQ.
* **Cross-map `MW_DELCHAR_REQ` cleanup** — when CLOSECHAR_ACK
  arrives for an unknown char (stale close), the legacy server
  fires DELCHAR back to the map so the map cleans up its half.
  W2 logs it and skips; the map server's own close-loop converges
  the state without our reply.
* **Guild/party/BR/BoW side-effects on ADDCHAR_ACK** — the
  legacy module touches `m_pBOWModule`, `m_pBRModule`, and looks
  up guild membership when a char enters. Each of those modules
  is its own W3+/W6 PR.

The W2..W7 split was sized against a real `grep` of
`Server/TWorldSvr/SSHandler.cpp` (287 unique handlers across 4
families: OnMW=160, OnDM=88, OnCT=23, OnSM=16) plus 3 handlers in
`RWHandler.cpp`. See §4 for the per-feature handler counts that
drove the split.

W3a adds `services/guild_registry.{h,cpp}`,
`services/guild_repository.h`, `services/soci_guild_repository.{h,cpp}`,
`db/schema_validator.{h,cpp}` (TGUILD + TGUILDMEMBER columns),
`handlers/handlers_guild.cpp` (76 handlers), and a peer-session
wrapper (`peer_session.h` parallel to TControlSvrAsio's). The
W2 char registry stays put — W3a guild handlers look chars up
through it, never duplicate state.

## 2. Build

The scaffold is wired into the root `CMakeLists.txt` next to the
four shipped Asio daemons:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --target tworldsvr_asio
ctest --test-dir build -R tworldsvr_asio --output-on-failure
```

W1 has one test — `tworldsvr_asio_dispatch` — that stands the
server up on an ephemeral port, frames a known wID, an unknown
wID, and a corrupt-checksum frame, and verifies the framer accepts
the first two and closes on the third.

## 3. Running

```bash
./build/Server/TWorldSvrAsio/tworldsvr_asio --config Server/TWorldSvrAsio/tworldsvr.example.toml
```

The W1 binary accepts SS connections on `DEF_WORLDPORT` (3815),
logs every inbound packet through the dispatch stub, and exposes
a `/healthz` HTTP endpoint on port 18087. It does NOT touch the
database — `[database]` in the TOML is parsed but unused until W2.

## 4. Phasing — how the SSHandler.cpp surface splits

Real counts from `grep` of the 287 unique `On(MW|DM|CT|SM)_*` names
in `Server/TWorldSvr/SSHandler.cpp` (the legacy monolithic switch),
plus 3 `OnRW_*` in `RWHandler.cpp`. The per-feature totals drive
the W2..W7 PR sizing — guild is its own PR (W3a) because at 76
handlers it is bigger than every other phase combined.

| Phase | Buckets | Handler count |
|---|---|---|
| W2 | CHAR (4) + USER (2) + OnRW (3) + ACTIVECHARUPDATE + GETCHARINFO + ADDCHAR + CHANGECHARBASE + CHECKCONNECT | ~15 |
| W3a | GUILD | 76 |
| W3b | PARTY (8) + CORPS (6) | 14 |
| W4 | FRIEND (18) + CHAT (3) + SOULMATE (8) | 29 |
| W5 | WAR (2) + CASTLE (5) + TOURNAMENT (15) + TNMT (3) | 25 |
| W6 | BR (3) + BOW (1) + EVENT (11) + RPSGAME (3) + APEX / ARENA / BATTLEMODE | ~30 |
| W7 | ITEM (5) + CASH (5) + MONTHRANK (3) + CMGIFT (7) + HELPMESSAGE + PVPRECORD + RESERVEDPOST + cutover hardening | ~30 |

Each ported handler in W2..W7 also gets its matching sender —
`Server/TWorldSvr/SSSender.cpp` is 4046 LOC / ~196 sender funcs,
so realistic effort per phase is **2× the handler count** (handler
+ sender + DB wrapper where applicable).

## 5. Architectural patches that land alongside the handler work

From PATCH_README §6:

| ID | Severity | Patch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| W-1 | 🟡 | Async DB + per-shard write queue (legacy `m_hDB` is a single DB thread serving all TMapSvr instances) | 🟡 W2 wires `SessionPool` + `boost::asio::thread_pool`; no queries issued yet (W3a guild is the first consumer) |
| W-2 | 🟡 | Partition the global `m_mapTCHAR` / `m_mapTGuild` locks (per-char actor model, per-guild grain) | 🟡 **char half done in W2** (16-shard registry + per-char mutex). Guild half lands in W3a. |
| W-3 | ✅ | TWorldSvrAsio binary doesn't exist yet | ✅ closed by W1 scaffold |

Other related concerns from `_rewrite/docs/MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md`:

* **`SSHandler.cpp` 14 615 LOC monolithic switch** — replaced by
  one `handlers/handlers_<feature>.cpp` per W2..W7 phase, dispatched
  through the W1 `Dispatch` stub which grows one `case` per ported
  handler. Same shape as `Server/TControlSvrAsio/handlers/`.
* **`DMSender.cpp` raw-pointer handoff** — 48 `new` / 1 visible
  `delete` for outbound DB write packets. The Asio port owns
  outbound bodies through `std::vector<std::byte>` + move semantics
  (see `WorldSession::SendPacket`), so the lifecycle hazard never
  reappears.
* **Threading model** — legacy `_ControlThread` + `_WorkThread` +
  `_BatchThread` (plus a `MAX_THREAD` worker pool) collapse onto a
  single `io_context`. CPU-bound batch work that needs off-reactor
  execution rides on the `db_pool` introduced in W2.
